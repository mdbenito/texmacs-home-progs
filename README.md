# My TeXmacs config #

This is just a collection of TeXmacs initialisation files and routines which I haven't committed to the trunk. Some are too specific or personal, others I just didn't find the time for it.

## What's here ###

In no particular order:

* Browsing to-do tags with the focus bar
* List all labels in the focus bar when in a reference tag
* Trees to item lists (abandoned)
* Splitting equations into equation arrays automatically and back.
* Autocomplete glue functions (**deprecated:** Philippe committed something better to the trunk)
* Lots of shortcuts (e.g. Fraktur letters, beamer presentations,...)
* ...

## Set up ##

Just link your ~/.TeXmacs/progs to this project's folder.
